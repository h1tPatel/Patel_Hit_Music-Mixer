//In this project, we want to enable users to interact with the beats by dragging and dropping them onto specific areas. To achieve this, we need to implement a drag and drop feature. When a user clicks and holds a beat icon, they should be able to move it around the screen and drop it onto a valid target area. We'll use event handlers to detect when a beat is being dragged and dropped, and we'll design the user interface to visually indicate where the beats can be dropped.
